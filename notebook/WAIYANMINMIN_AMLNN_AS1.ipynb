        "### Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Transfer learning remains effective:** DenseNet-121 provides a solid baseline for multi-label chest X-ray classification with limited training epochs.\n",
        "2. **Label choice is now data-driven:** The model is trained on the top 5 labels with the highest positive-sample counts in the training set, improving statistical support for evaluation.\n",
        "3. **Class imbalance still influences behaviour:** Even among frequent labels, per-label precision/recall/F1 can vary considerably.\n",
        "4. **A fixed threshold has trade-offs:** Using 0.5 is straightforward, but per-label threshold tuning could improve minority error profiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "- A small epoch budget may limit convergence and final predictive quality.\n",
        "- Label uncertainty (`-1`) is mapped to `0`, which may introduce label-noise bias.\n",
        "- Oversampling is intentionally removed in this version, so imbalance mitigation is not explicitly applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recommended Improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "- Tune per-label thresholds on validation data.\n",
        "- Test imbalance-aware losses (class-weighted BCE or focal loss).\n",
        "- Add learning-rate scheduling, early stopping, and checkpoint selection.\n",
        "- Compare DenseNet-121 with at least one alternative backbone.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This updated notebook evaluates a pre-trained DenseNet-121 pipeline for multi-label chest X-ray classification using the **top 5 most frequent labels** selected from training data and a **non-oversampled** training setup. The workflow still satisfies assignment goals by covering architecture inspection, training/validation evaluation, confusion-matrix analysis, and practical interpretation with clear next-step improvements."
